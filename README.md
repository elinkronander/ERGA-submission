# ERGA-submission

A collection of scripts developed by members of the ERGA Community in order to facilitate the correct upload of sequencing data and research objects associated with a genome assembly project to ENA. The scripts are designed to create the xml files required in order to submit research objects associated with a genome assembly project via the creation of the relevant Studies, Runs, Experiments and Analysis Objects in ENA, all under a common Umbrella BioProject.

## BGE
Contains a guide for members of the BGE project with creating Studies and other relevent objects in ENA, followed by the submission of sequencing data and genome assemblies.

## get_submission_xmls
Contains python scripts to create the xml files required for submission of a sequencing project to ENA

This is just a test
